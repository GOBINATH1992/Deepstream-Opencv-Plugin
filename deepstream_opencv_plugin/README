Refer to the DeepStream SDK documentation for a description of the plugin.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pre-requisites:
- GStreamer-1.0 Development package
- GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins Development package

Install using:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev
On x86 :  sudo apt-get install -y cuda-compat-12-1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling and installing the plugin:
Export or set in Makefile the appropriate cuda version using CUDA_VER , Deepstream version using DS_VER
To disable cuda acclerated decoding set USE_CPU=1 

On x86 : export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/compat:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Required for data center GPUs only)
Run make and sudo make install

NOTE: To compile the sources, run make with "sudo" or root permission.

About:
This plugin uses  Opencv with CUDA accleration to  read video stream and fed them into gstreamer pipeline directly to GPU output buffers using the
video/x-raw(memory:NVMM) data type.

Set location  property to the  stream to be read
Set  memtype property  in plugin to 3 CUDA UNIFIED Memory 

NOTE:
1. Currently this plugin is only supported on X86. 
2. This plugin only support CUDA UNIFIED Memory  so set memtype field in plugin to 3 
3  This pluign only output RGBA buffers others format are not supported



Run:
For X86 device:
Run following pipeline on DGPU setup.
gst-launch-1.0 nvvideotestsrc location=url memtype=3  ! queue ! fakesink -e
