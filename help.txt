- GStreamer-1.0 Base Plugins Development package
- Linux: Driver version 470.57.02 or higher
- CUDA 11.0 or higher Toolkit

Install using:
   sudo apt-get install libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer1.0-dev
On x86 :  sudo apt-get install -y cuda-compat-12-1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Compiling Opencv from source, installing and testing the plugin:
Export or set in the appropriate Deepstream version using DS_VER in install.sh
Export or set in the appropriate SM_COMPUTE value using SM_COMPUTE in  install.sh Refer https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus
To disable cuda acclerated decoding set USE_CPU=1 

Run chmod a+x install.sh  and ./install.sh

About:
This plugin uses  Opencv with CUDA accleration to  read video stream and fed them into gstreamer pipeline directly to GPU output buffers using the
video/x-raw(memory:NVMM) data type.

NOTE:
1. Currently gst-nvvideotestsrc plugin is only supported on X86 and CUDA_UNIFIED_MEMORY. 
2. This pluign only output RGBA buffers others format are not supported

Post installation :
nano	~/.bashrc
add follwing lines at end
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages
export PYTHONPATH
